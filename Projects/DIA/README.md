Stack Club session 07 

# New additions to this repository : 

some resources that we can draw from for generating our stack club DIA notebook(s).
All are in ''StackClubCourse/Projects/DIA/''

1. DESC01_Create_Calexp_Repo.ipynb
2. DESC02_Fake_Injection.ipynb
3. DESC02a_Grid_Injection.ipynb

These three notebooks are from Shu Liu, PhD student working with Michael Wood-Vasey at Pitt.  Shu has been working on a DESC project, planting fake stars into DC2 images and measuring the detection efficiency, particularly around bright stars.   These are preliminary, and are very DC2-specific in some ways, but they work!
