    "\n",
    "This worksheet is a demonstration of how to do the following:\n",
    "1. Locate a specific object from available databases in the Stack using its right ascension and declination coordinates\n",
    "2. Obtain a thumbnail of the object for image analysis\n",
    "3. Create nice RGB images from multiband exposure\n",
    "4. Mask unwanted sources surrounding and overlapping the object using source detection footprints and Holoviews\n",
    "5. Do quick surface photometry of the object on the masked image, with a local background estimation\n",
    "\n",
    "The basic goal is to provide a demonstration of one way to perform one's own image analysis within the Stack, on present and future imaging data releases.  It can be used as a stepping off point for development of one's own software.\n",

We note that around 230 pixels in radius, however, there is a drastic decline in surface brightness.
